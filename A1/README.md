# A1 — Working with Open Data

**Dataset:** Burke-Gilman Trail counter north of NE 70th St

## Questions I asked
Q1. When is the trail busiest, and when is it quietest? Decide what busy means to you first — a single hour? a stretch of the day? bikes and peds together, or separately? — and say why you chose that.
**Q2. Do cyclists and pedestrians use the trail at different times of day?** Compare their hourly patterns. If they differ, what might explain it?
**Q3. Commuting or recreation?**
Is there evidence people use the Burke-Gilman to *commute*, not just for fun? Compare **weekdays vs. weekends** (we made a `weekday` column for you), and maybe morning vs. evening. Define what a "commuting pattern" would look like in the data, then say whether you see it.
**Q4. Direction and flow.**
The counter records **north vs. south** separately. Are mornings mostly one direction and evenings the other? What would that tell you about who's using the trail and where they're heading?

## How to re-run
Open `A1.ipynb` and run all cells (needs `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
